First project.. yay!

#Day One 
This project is a basic one to my personal development, so I can get better little by little. I hope I improve my skills.

Just realized how hard git is, and I am really struggling with it lol.

#Day Two
Finally mastered github, now I know that in order to update the remote
repository i have to do some pushes :)

#Day Three
I finished my very first project in python, is pretty simple but
I really enjoyed the experience. Tells me that I am on the right track.
